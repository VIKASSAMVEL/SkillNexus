## Implementation Details

### Core Features Implementation

#### ✅ User Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- User registration and login endpoints
- Profile management with user information
- Token-based authorization middleware

**Example: JWT Middleware (backend/middleware/auth.js)**
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Access token required' });
  
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};

module.exports = { authenticateToken };
```

#### ✅ Skills Management System
- Complete CRUD operations for skills
- Skill categories system (Technology, Languages, Arts & Crafts, etc.)
- Filtering by category, proficiency level, and availability
- User-specific skill management
- Pricing structure (per hour and per session)

**Example: Skills API Route (backend/routes/skills.js)**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Joi = require('joi');
const pool = require('../config/database');

const router = express.Router();

const skillSchema = Joi.object({
  name: Joi.string().required(),
  category: Joi.string().required(),
  description: Joi.string().required(),
  hourly_rate: Joi.number().min(0),
  session_rate: Joi.number().min(0)
});

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const { error, value } = skillSchema.validate(req.body);
  if (error) return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Validation error', error: error.details[0].message });

  const [result] = await pool.execute(
    'INSERT INTO skills (user_id, name, category, description, hourly_rate, session_rate) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
    [req.user.id, value.name, value.category, value.description, value.hourly_rate, value.session_rate]
  );
  
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Skill created', skillId: result.insertId });
});

module.exports = router;
```

#### ✅ Geo-Location Features
- Google Maps integration for location-based skill search
- Interactive map view with skill markers
- Location-based filtering within customizable radius
- Current location detection and reverse geocoding

**Example: Location-based Query**
```sql
SELECT s.*, u.name, u.location,
       6371 * acos(cos(radians(?)) * cos(radians(u.latitude)) *
       cos(radians(u.longitude) - radians(?)) + sin(radians(?)) * sin(radians(u.latitude))) as distance
FROM skills s JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.id
WHERE distance <= ?
ORDER BY distance
```

#### ✅ Database Design
- MySQL database with 12+ tables including users, skills, bookings, projects, reviews
- Proper relationships and foreign keys
- Sample data seeding for testing
- Connection pooling for performance

#### ✅ Backend API
- Node.js/Express server with security middleware
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
- Input validation using Joi
- Error handling and logging
- CORS and security headers

#### ✅ Frontend Setup
- React.js application with Material-UI
- Component-based architecture
- Routing with React Router
- Axios for API communication
- Responsive design foundation

**Example: React Component (frontend/src/components/SkillCard.js)**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Card, CardContent, Typography, Button } from '@mui/material';

const SkillCard = ({ skill, onSelect }) => (
  <Card sx={{ p: 2, borderRadius: 2, boxShadow: 2 }}>
    <Typography variant="h6">{skill.name}</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">{skill.category}</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">${skill.hourly_rate}/hour</Typography>
    <Button variant="contained" onClick={() => onSelect(skill)}>Book Now</Button>
  </Card>
);

export default SkillCard;
```
