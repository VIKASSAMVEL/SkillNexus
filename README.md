# Urban Skill Exchange: A Full-Stack Platform for Hyperlocal Talent Sharing

## Project Overview

**Automatic Zoom WEB HACKATHON**

This project is developed as part of the WEB HACKATHON challenge to address the need for a streamlined, trustworthy platform for hyperlocal talent sharing in urban environments. The platform enables users to create profiles, list their skills or learning needs, and connect with others in their locality for skill exchange, micro-consulting, or collaborative projects.

## Problem Statement

In rapidly growing urban environments, many individuals possess unique skills—ranging from digital expertise to traditional crafts, tutoring, fitness, or language abilities—but lack a streamlined, trustworthy way to share or monetize these skills within their immediate communities. Conversely, residents often seek local, affordable, and verified help or learning opportunities but struggle to connect with the right people in their vicinity.

## Challenge

Build a full-stack web platform that enables users to create profiles, list their skills or learning needs, and connect with others in their locality for skill exchange, micro-consulting, or collaborative projects.

## Core Platform Features

### 1. User Authentication & Verification
- Secure sign-up/login
- Optional identity verification
- Skill validation through peer reviews or digital badges

### 2. Geo-Location Matching
- Users can discover and filter skill offerings or requests
- Search within a customizable radius

### 3. Booking & Scheduling
- Built-in calendar for scheduling sessions
- Automated reminders and conflict detection

### 4. Reputation System
- Ratings, testimonials, and skill endorsements to foster trust and reliability

### 5. Community Projects
- Users can propose or join collaborative projects (e.g., building a community garden, coding a local website, organizing a workshop)

### 6. Incentive Mechanism
- Optional token or credit system to encourage participation
- Credits can be redeemed for services or donated to community causes

### 7. Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Features for differently-abled users, such as voice navigation, high-contrast modes, and language localization

## Bonus Points Features
- Integrating AI-based skill recommendations or matching algorithms
- Real-time chat or video session capabilities
- Providing an Open API for third-party integrations (e.g., local NGOs, educational institutions)

## Objective

Create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly full-stack web application that not only facilitates hyperlocal skill exchange but also strengthens community bonds and fosters economic empowerment in urban neighborhoods.
