WEB HACKATHON
Problem Statement:
In rapidly growing urban environments, many individuals possess unique skills—rangingfrom digital expertise to traditional crafts, tutoring, fitness, or language abilities—but
lack a streamlined, trustworthy way to share or monetize these skills within their
immediate communities. Conversely, residents often seek local, affordable, and verified
help or learning opportunities but struggle to connect with the right people in their
vicinity.
Challenge:
Build a full-stack web platform that enables users to create profiles, list their skills orlearning needs, and connect with others in their locality for skill exchange, micro-
consulting, or collaborative projects.
Core Platform Features:
1. User Authentication & Verification:    * Secure sign-up/login.    * Optional identity verification.    * Skill validation through peer reviews or digital badges.2. Geo-Location Matching:    * Users can discover and filter skill offerings or requests.    * Search within a customizable radius.3. Booking & Scheduling:    * Built-in calendar for scheduling sessions.    * Automated reminders and conflict detection.4. Reputation System:    * Ratings, testimonials, and skill endorsements to foster trust and reliability.5. Community Projects:    * Users can propose or join collaborative projects (e.g., building a community garden,coding a local website, organizing a workshop).6. Incentive Mechanism:    * Optional token or credit system to encourage participation.    * Credits can be redeemed for services or donated to community causes.

7. Accessibility & Inclusivity: Features for differently-abled users, such as voice navigation, high-contrast modes,and language localization.
Bonus Points For:
* Integrating AI-based skill recommendations or matching algorithms.* Real-time chat or video session capabilities.* Providing an Open API for third-party integrations (e.g., local NGOs, educationalinstitutions).
Objective:
Create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly full-stack web application that not onlyfacilitates hyperlocal skill exchange but also strengthens community bonds and fosters
economic empowerment in urban neighborhoods.
